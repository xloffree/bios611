This is an analysis of match data from the 2022 FIFA World Cup.


makefile: Make file that builds the project. Use this to easily build individual outputs.  
BIOS611project.pdf: Report of final project with all code, output, text, and findings.  
BIOS611project.Rmd: Corresponding Rmd file for final report.  
Dockerfile: Creates a containerized environment in which the code for this project can be easily run.  
loon_plots.Rmd: Separate file to display interactive linked plots made with the loon R package. There were problems incorporating the loon package into the Docker environment, so this is a standalone file not a part of the makefile or Docker environment.

All other files are segments of code in Rmd format from BIOS611project.Rmd as well as associated inputs and outputs. Details on the inputs and outputs of each of these Rmd files can be found in the makefile. For additional explanation on each of these code segments, see the corresponding sections in BIOS611project.Rmd.
