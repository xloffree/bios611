```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
So how did the algorithm make the clustering decisions?
Let's check if it clustered the teams based on how well they performed in the
tournament.
The five groups can be:
1. Eliminated in group stage (n=16)
2. Eliminated in round of 16 (n=8)
3. Eliminated in quarter finals (n=4)
4. Eliminated in semi-finals (n=2)
5. Finalists (n=2)


```{r}

coords_df <- read.csv("avg_team_data_cont.csv")


place_g2 <- c("final", "16", "group", "quarter", "group", "group", "group",
              "semi", "group", "group", "quarter", "final", "group", "group",
              "group", "16", "16", "group", "semi", "quarter", "16", "quarter",
              "group", "group", "16", "group", "16", "16", "group", "16",
              "group", "group")
coords_df$place_g2 <- place_g2
write.csv(coords_df, "avg_team_data_rank.csv")
```
